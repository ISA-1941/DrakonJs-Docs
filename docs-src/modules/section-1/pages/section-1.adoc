== SECTION 1. Abstract Data Types

[abstract]
This section introduces the concept of Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and explores both linear and non-linear data structures. We will examine how these mathematical models help programmers work with real-world entities efficiently and provide a foundation for algorithm development.

=== 1.1. ADT Concept

Before describing data structures, we must first define the concepts of 'data', 'data type', and 'data structure'. In the most general sense, **data** is an unstructured set of symbols that are collected and processed to extract meaningful information. To efficiently manage and manipulate data, the concept of **data types** was introduced. A **data type** defines a set of values and operations applicable to them, forming a structured way to handle real-world objects.

Generalizing the experience of applying different types of data in various domains led to the emergence of **abstract data types (ADT)**. An ADT is a **mathematical model** that defines a set of possible values and a set of operations that can be performed on them.

The concept of ADT was first described by Donald Knuth in his classical work *‚ÄúThe Art of Programming‚Äù*, where he outlined **data structures** as a way of organizing data efficiently. Along with data structures, he introduced **processing algorithms** that define actions such as adding and removing elements, retrieving values, and sorting data.

Some common examples of ADTs include:

* **Boolean** - A logical ADT with values {true, false}. Operations include logical conjunction (&&), disjunction (||), and negation (!).

* **Integer** - A numeric ADT that represents whole numbers {‚Ä¶, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ‚Ä¶}. Operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* **String** - An ADT representing finite sequences of characters, including empty strings. Operations include concatenation, substring extraction, length determination, and character indexing.

* **Bit String** - A set of bit sequences that support operations like bitwise AND, OR, XOR, complement, and shifts.

According to Steve McConnell, the author of *‚ÄúCode Complete‚Äù*, abstract data types allow programmers to work with **real-world entities** rather than low-level implementation details. Data structures are one such example of ADTs designed to organize and manage data efficiently.

A simplified classification of data structures can be presented as follows:

Each data structure has its own advantages and disadvantages, making it necessary to analyze them in terms of **memory efficiency** and **data access time**.

Data structures can be broadly classified into **linear and non-linear structures**:

1. **Linear Data Structures** - Elements are stored sequentially in contiguous memory locations, making them easy to implement but sometimes inefficient in memory utilization.
2. **Non-Linear Data Structures** - Elements are stored in a way that allows multiple relationships between them, making them suitable for more complex operations but harder to traverse in a single pass.

Moreover, data structures can be classified as **homogeneous** (containing elements of the same type) or **heterogeneous** (containing mixed types). Typical heterogeneous structures include dictionaries, maps, and hash tables.


=== 1.2. Linear Abstract Data Types

==== 1.2.1. Arrays

An **array** is a fundamental data structure that stores a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. Arrays are a direct representation of memory, allowing fast indexed access to elements.

[.text-center]
image::image$Fig1_2_Array.jpg[width=100%]

##### **Characteristics of Arrays:**

- Homogeneous (all elements have the same type).
- Fixed size (predefined and cannot change dynamically).
- Random access (elements are accessed using an index).
- Contiguously stored in memory.

##### **Main Operations on Arrays:**

- Retrieve an element at index N.
- Insert an element at a specific index.
- Determine the array‚Äôs length.

##### **Advantages of Arrays:**

- Fast element retrieval using an index.
- Efficient use of memory in contiguous allocation.
- Suitable for fixed-size data storage.

##### **Limitations of Arrays:**

- Size must be defined at initialization.
- Insertion and deletion operations can be costly.
- Inefficient use of memory when dealing with dynamic data.

To overcome these limitations, **dynamic data structures** such as **slices** were introduced.

üîπ Applications of Arrays:

*  Storing fixed-size collections of elements of the same type: Example: list of days of the week, months of the year, tabular data.

*  Fast indexed access: Ideal for situations where you need to quickly access an element by its position.

* Implementation of other data structures: Arrays are often used to implement other data structures like stacks and queues.

* Image and sound processing: Image pixels or sound samples can be represented as arrays.

* Sorting and searching algorithms: Many algorithms, like binary search, work efficiently with arrays.


==== 1.2.2. Linked Lists

A **linked list** is an ordered collection of elements where each element (node) contains **a value and a reference to the next element**.

.Figure 1.3. Representation of a Linked List

image::image$Fig1_3_ll.jpg[width=100%]


##### **Types of Linked Lists:**

1. **Singly Linked List** - Each node points to the next node.
2. **Doubly Linked List** - Each node has references to both the next and previous nodes.
3. **Circular Linked List** - The last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.

##### **Main Operations on Linked Lists:**

- Insert a new node at the beginning, middle, or end.
- Remove a node based on value or position.
- Traverse the list to find elements.

üîπ Applications of Linked Lists:

* Dynamic data storage: When the size of the data is unknown or changes frequently.

* implementation of stacks and queues: Linked lists can be used to implement these data structures.

* Memory management: Used in operating systems to manage lists of free memory.

* Implementation of playlists: In music or video players.

* Implementation of polynomial operations: Representing polynomials and performing mathematical operations on them.

==== 1.2.3. Stacks and Queues

A **stack** is a **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** structure where elements are added and removed from the same end.

Figure 1.4. Stack Structure


A **queue** is a **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** structure where elements are added at the back and removed from the front.

Figure 1.5. Queue Structure

##### **Common Variations:**

- **Circular Queue** - The last element connects back to the first.
- **Priority Queue** - Elements are dequeued based on priority rather than order.

üîπ Applications of Stacks:

* Function call processing: The stack is used to store information about function calls.

* Implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms: In graphs and trees.

* Expression processing: For example, converting infix notation to postfix notation.

* Undo/redo functionality: In text editors and graphics programs.

* Checking for balanced parentheses: In compilers and interpreters.

üîπ Applications of Queues:

* Processing tasks in the order they arrive: Example: print queue, server request queue.

* Implementation of Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms: In graphs and trees.

* Modeling real-world queues: In supermarkets, banks, etc.

* Message processing: In messaging systems.

* Task scheduling in operating systems: For managing processes.

A tree is an acyclic connected graph with a designated root node, formally defined as:

E ‚äÇ V√óV (directed edges)
‚àÉ! root ‚àà V ‚àÄv ‚àà V ‚àÉ unique path from root to v
