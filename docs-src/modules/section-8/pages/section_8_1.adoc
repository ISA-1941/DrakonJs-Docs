== SECTION 8. BINARY TREE ALGORITHMS

=== 8.1 Representation of binary trees
Four types of imbalanced states exist.
Binary trees as an abstract data type were discussed in the first
section, here we will talk about the computer implementation of this
type of data structures using the visual algorithmic language DRAKON and
the programming language JavaScript. Recall the basic terminology of binary trees (Figure 8.1):

image::_images/Fig8_1_Term.jpg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.1. Basic tree terminology

_Root:_ The root of the tree is the only node with no incoming edges. It
is the top node in the tree;

_Node:_ This is the basic element of the tree. Each node has data and
two references that can point to zero or its descendants;Edge: This is
also the fundamental part of the tree and is used to connect the two
node points.

_Path:_ A path is an ordered list of nodes connected by edges.

_Leaf:_ A leaf node is a node that has no descendants.

_Tree height:_ The height of a tree is the number of edges on the
longest path between the root and the leaf.

_Node level:_ Node level is the number of edges on the path from the
root node of this node.

The information structure of the binary tree is organised as follows (Figure 8.2):

Fig.8.2 Binary tree structure (_info_ - value (key), (N - NULL))

Several types of binary trees are discussed in the training literature, the most important of which is classification based on node values:

- a binary search tree;
- AVL-Tree;
- Red-Black Tree.

=== 8.2 Binary search tree

==== 8.2.1 Building a binary tree

If the tree is organised in such a way that, for each node, all the node
values of its left subtree are less than this node and all the values of
its right subtree are greater, it is called a binary search tree. A BST
is a recursive data structure because each subtree is also a tree. A BST
has the following tree properties consists of nodes that retain unique values;

- each node has zero, one or two child nodes;

- one of the nodes is referred to as the root node, which is at the top of the tree structure;

- each node has only one parent node, except for the root node which has
no parent node;

- the value of each node is greater than that of its left child but less than that of its right child;

A binary search tree is built according to a certain algorithm. Consider the sequence of integers \{11, 5, 17, 15, 1, 8, 19, 13, 21}, represented as a slice of numbers[]. First the root node \{11} is formed, then in the loop for each node recursively the method
`insert(tree, value)` is called (Fig. 8.3 a), which in turn calls the method `createNode(value)`, which creates a new node (Fig. 8.3 b).

[.text-center]
Fig.8.3 a,b Binary tree DRAKON-diagrams

a) building a tree by insert(node,value); b) creating a node

The complete process of creating a binary tree is shown in Figure 8.4.
The first number 11 is written to the root of the tree. The second
number 5 is less than the value in the tree root, so it is written to
the left subtree. The next number 17 is greater than the root number, so
it is written to the right subtree. Then the number 15 is greater than
the value at the root of the tree, so it is written to the right
subtree, but the right subtree is already built. The number 15 is
compared to the number 17 at the root of the right subtree. Since the
value to be added is less than the value in the root of the right
subtree, we add the left subtree to this node. The final result is a
binary search tree with three variants: a node 5 is the parent of two
children (1,8), a node 15 has only a left child, and a node 19 has only
a right child. This arrangement of nodes is chosen to demonstrate the
function of removing nodes, which will be discussed later.

8.2.3 Finding a node based on a set value

Another basic operation is the `findNode(value)` function. This function uses a JavaScript instructions construct, which recursively compares the value of
val with the values of other nodes as it traverses the tree. 
The DRAKON-diagram of the `findNode(node, value)`function is shown in Figure 8.5.

8.2.3 Deleting a node with a specified value

The next basic operation is to delete a node with the specified  value. The function `removeNode (node,value)` is used recursively. 

Let's analyse in more detail the order in which the nodes are moved in these variants.

_Option a):_ Node (21) has no descendants (Figure 8.6.).

In this case, this node is removed by changing the value of `node = null` in the parent node. Figure 8.6. shows the process of deleting node (21)
and the corresponding DRAKON-diagram fragment

image::_images/Fig8__8_del21_Js.png[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.6. Deleting a node without childs

_Option b):_ Node (19) has a right-hand descendant (Figure 8.7).

In this case, node (19) is removed from the tree by replacing its
address in the parent node (17) with the address of its only descendant
node (21). Figure 8.7. shows the process of removing node (19) and the corresponding DRAKON-diagram fragment.

[.text-center]
Figure 8.7. Deleting node (19) with right-hand descendant

_Option c):_ Node (8) has a left-hand child (Figure 8.8.).

In this case, node (8) is removed from the tree by replacing its
address in parent node (5) with the address of its only left child node (6). Figure 8.8. shows the process of removing node (8) and the
corresponding DRAKON-diagram fragment.

Figure 8.8. Deleting node (8) with left-hand child

_Variant d):_ Node (5) has two descendants (Figure 8.9.). In this case
the binary search tree is rearranged: node (2) moves to the place of node (5):

8.2.4. Traversing the binary search tree

One of the basic tree operations is to traverse tree nodes. Unlike linear data structures, where elements are traversed in a linear order, tree nodes can be traversed in a variety of ways. 
The traversal, in which each ancestor node is viewed before its descendants, is called a pre-ordered walk or direct-order traversal (_pre-order walk_). There is also an _in-order walk_, where the left subtree is visited from bottom to top, then the root node, then the right subtree. The traversal, in which first descendants are viewed and then ancestors, is called a post-ordered or reverse-order traversal (_post-order walk_). All three cases, including the Dragon diagrams, are shown in the Figure 8.12.

image::_images/Fig8_12_PreInPost.jpg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.12. Three Classical Tree Traversals: Pre-, In-, Post-Order

=== 8.3 Self-balancing binary trees (AVL-trees)

The efficiency of any tree operation depends substantially on the order in which the input data is received. For example, if an incoming sequence of numbers is partially sorted in ascending or descending order, this structure will no longer look like a tree (Figure 8.13).

image::_images/Fig8_13_avl.jpg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.13. Partially sorted input data

In such practically "degenerate" trees, the complexity of the operations is determined by the number of nodes, i.e. it is almost linear - O(n).
The left and right subtrees are unbalanced, which can be estimated by the balance coefficient (kb), which is equal to the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees. Recall that the height of a tree is defined as the length of the longest branch in a subtree (sum of edges). For an ideal binary search tree (a tree where the number of nodes in the left subtree is equal to the number of nodes in the right subtree), this factor is 0 (Figure 8.14).

image::_images/Fig8_14_idealTree.jpg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.14. An ideal binary tree

In real life, ideal binary trees are almost never achieved; programmers often try to build a tree where the height of the left subtree differs from the height of the right subtree by no more than 1. Such trees are called AVL-trees; for such trees the complexity of operations is defined as O(logn), i.e. the execution time of basic operations (search, remove) is significantly less than for BST-trees.

The algorithms for such trees are based on the process of balancing the tree when a new node is inserted or an existing node is removed. The purpose of balancing is to reconstruct the tree so that the heights of the left and right subtrees do not differ by more than 1. The balancing factor must satisfy the following conditions allowable values kb = -1, 0 and +1;

* The value kb = -1 indicates that the right subtree "outweighs" the
left subtree;
* The value kb= +1 indicates that the left subtree "outweighs" the right
subtree;
* a value of kb = 0 indicates that the tree contains an equal number of
nodes on each side, i.e. the tree is perfectly balanced.

The balancing algorithm in its most general form is presented in the following DRAKON-scheme (Figure 8.15)

mage::_images/Fig8_15_buildingAvlTree.jpg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.15. The balancing algorithm in its most general view 

The balancing technique boils down to making circular movements of the nodes in four variants:

* right turn (RR);
* Left turn (LL);
* Right - left turn (RL);
* Left to right turn (LR).

The right-hand turn is performed when the root node has a balance factor kb = +2 and its left-hand child has a balance factor kb = +1 (Figure 8.16):

image::_images/Fig8_16_RR_turn.jpg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.16. Right turn

The left-hand turn is performed when the root node has a balanced kb = - 2 and its right-hand descendant has a balanced kb = - 1 (Figure 8.17):

image::_images/Fig8_17_LL_turn.jpg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.17. Left turn

A right-left turn is performed when the root node has a balance factor
kb = -2 and its right-hand child has a balance factor kb = +1 (Figure
8.18):

image::_images/Fig8_18_RL_turn.jpg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.18. Right-left turn

Left-right rotation is performed when a node has a balance factor of kb = +2 and its left child has a balance factor of kb = -1 (Figure 8.19):

image::_images/Fig8_19_LR_turn.jpg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.19. Left-right turn

Consider the balancing process in more detail with an example of tree formation when input data is received in this order: [1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21]. As shown above, such a tree is unbalanced.

Balance checking are started on the arrival of each new node using the `insertNode(node, value)` function, which determines the position of the new node in the left or right subtree relative to the root node. The choice of the balancing path is determined by the method
`rotateInsert(node, value)`. A DRAKON-diagrams of the algorithms of the above methods is shown in Figure 8.20. 

image::_images/Fig8_20_insertNode.svg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.20. DRAKON-diagram depicting the method of inserting node

The choice of one of the possible balancing paths (rotations) is determined by the `rotateInsert(node, val)` function (Figure 8.21).

image::_images/Fig8_21_avlRotateIinsert.svg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.21. DRAKON-diagram depicting the inserting node method

Depending on the location of the new node relative to the parent node and the balance factor values, the left-hand or right-hand rotation methods are performed (Figure 8.22):

image::_images/Fig8_22_twoRotates.jpg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.22. Node rotation programme codes

Let's look at the tree rebuilding process in detail as a result of using the `rotateInsert(node, val)` method on the example of entering the values of three nodes (5,6,8). After receiving the value of last node (8), a "twig" appears instead of the tree that needs to be balanced. In this case the condition in the `rotateInsert(node, val)` method is met: the balancing factor is 2 and the value of node (8) is more,than the parent node (6) and the `rotateLeft(node)` method is called. The balancing process in this case is shown in Figure 8.23:

The process of new nodes arriving and rebuilding the resulting AVL-tree by balancing for the input set [1,2,5,6,8,11,13,15,17,19,21] is shown in Figure 8.24.

Figure 8.25. DRAKON-diagram depicting the finding a node method

Another basic operation, deleting a node with a specified value, consists of the following steps. The node is searched from the root down through the branches to the node to be deleted. The following situations may occur (Figure 8.27):

image::_images/Fig8_26_varDelNode.jpg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
8.26. Cases for nodes to be removed

{empty}a) The node to be deleted has two non-empty descendants;

{empty}b) The node to be deleted has no descendants;

{empty}c) The node to be deleted has one descendant (left or right).

As with the other methods, a node with a c value is first recursively identified and then one of the options presented is selected. A DRAKON-diagram of the algorithm for deleting a node with the cases for nodes to be removed value is shown in Figure 8.27.

=== 8.4 Red-black trees

==== 8.4.1. Properties of red-black trees

A red-black tree is a variant of a self-balancing binary search tree in
which the nodes are placed according to a certain rule and coloured red
or black (Figure 8.29)

image::_images/Fig8_29_redblackTree.png[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.29. Red-Black Tree

The nodes containing data (in this case, integers) are internal. In
addition, red-black trees contain imaginary, "null" nodes associated
with tree leaves (Null - in Figure 8.29). Red-black trees satisfy all
the properties of a binary search tree and must have the following
properties:

{empty}1. Each node is coloured red or black.

{empty}2. The root of the tree is always black.

{empty}3. All leaves are black (Null).

{empty}4. Both descendants of the red node are black, i.e. there cannot
be consecutive red nodes.

{empty}5. All simple paths from the node to the descending leaves
contain the same number of black nodes.

Unlike AVL trees, where balance is achieved by balancing the heights of
the left and right subtrees, red-black balance is achieved by the
properties mentioned above. Adding or removing a node from the red-black
tree can disrupt the red-black tree properties, and restoring balance is
achieved by two operations: repainting the nodes and/or rebuilding the
whole tree or its subtrees using specific rotations.The most important
of these properties are properties 4 and 5.

Property 4 dictates a critical aspect of red-black trees: the path from any given node to its deepest descendant must contain an equal number of red and black nodes. This isn't just an arbitrary rule; it's a fundamental mechanism for maintaining balance.

Property 5 builds on this by enforcing a uniform "black-height" for all paths from any node to its leaf descendants. Regardless of the specific path taken, the count of black nodes remains constant.

Black height is an important term used for red-black trees. This is the number of black nodes on any single path from node x (not including it) to the leaf. The black height of any node x is represented as a logarithm of the number of nodes in the tree. In particular, if in each branch from the root to the leaves the same number of black nodes, then the height of the tree will be equal to a logarithm of the number of nodes. This property allows you to quickly perform basic operations of the search tree, such as adding, removing and searching for a node.

To perform the above operations at the program level, a red-black tree is first created, for which two user types - node and RBTree are declared:
Node includes the following fields: `data` - node numeric value,  `colour` - node colour type bool: `red node` - TRUE; `black node` - false, `left`, `right` and `parent` nodes. In turn RBTree structure represents the reference type variable, that store objects containing not the "value" itself but a reference to the memory area where this object is stored (Fig. 8.30).

==== 8.4.2. Inserting a new node and the balancing process

In the most general way the red-black tree construction algorithm is presented by the function `Insert(tree, value)`(Figure 8.32):

image::_images/Fig8_32_Insert.jpg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.32. DRAKON-diagram of the function `Insert(tree, data)`

Next, consider the node positions in the tree as a result of each new
node insertion and determine which properties of the red-black tree are
violated. To understand this process, we introduce the following
notation: x - new node, P (Parent) - parent of node x, G (Grandparent) -
ancestor (parent of parent), U (Uncle) - uncle of node x, S - siblings (Figure 8.33).

image::_images/Fig8_33_family.jpg[width=75%]

[.text-center]
Figure 8.33. Designation of the degree of "kinship" of RB Tree nodes (x, P, G, U, S)  

To describe the process of balancing the red-black tree, let’s name the set of nodes involved in the implementation of balancing _tree-cluster_ and enter a local syntax:
*:R or :B* is the color of the node. For example, P:R is the red parent.
*<= or =>* - the direction of the node position. For example, x <= P - the new node x is located to the left of the parent node P. 
The different instances of the red and black nodes are shown in the table
When a new element is inserted, it is assigned a red colour. To satisfy
the first two rules, it is sufficient to simply repaint the new vertices
in the desired colour. After each insertion, all these properties of the
red-black tree must be checked. If at least one property is not
satisfactory, the rotation and colour change operations are performed (Table ).


|===
| Variant | nodeImage | Violation | Fix strategy


| Red Uncle
| x:R,x<=P; P:R,P<=G; G:B; U:R
| Both x and P are red; G has two red children (P and U).
| Recolor P and U to black (P:B, U:B), G to red (G:R); set x = G (propagate upward).

| Black Uncle Case 1 (L–L)
| x:R,x<=P; P:R,P<=G; G:B; U:B
| x and P are both red and lie on left-left; uncle is black.
| Recolor P to black (P:B) and G to red (G:R); Right-rotate about (G).

| Black Uncle Case 2 (R–R)
| x:R,x=>P; P:R,P=>G; G:B; U:B
| x and P are both red and lie on right-right; uncle is black.
| Recolor P to black (P:B) and G to red (G:R); Left-rotate about (G).

| Black Uncle Case 3 (L–R)
| x:R,x=>P; P:R,P<=G; G:B; U:B
| both x and P are red; x is right child of P, P is left child of G; uncle is black; 
| Left-rotate about (P), then treat as (L–L).

| Black Uncle Case 4 s(R–L)
| x:R,x<=P; P:R,P=>G; G:B; U:B
| x is left child of P, P is right child of G; both x and P are red; uncle is black; 
| Right-rotate about (P), then treat as (R–R).

==== 8.4.3. Deleting a Node from a red-black tree

Removing a node from a RB tree is a complex process because
it depends on the location of the node, the presence of children, and
the colour of the nodes. It is important to remember that all
transformations of the tree structure must maintain its properties. The
DRAKON-diagram of the node removal algorithm is shown in Figures 8.38a,b. This
algorithm can be divided into three stages.

image::_images/Fig8_38b_deleteNode.jpg[width=75%]


[.text-center]
Figure 8.38. Node Deletion Algorithm (a -intellect map; b - DRAKON-diagram)

*The first step* is to delete the node. The algorithm traverses the
nodes of the red-black tree, moving left or right, depending on whether
the key of the current node is larger or smaller than the specified
value. When a node with the key key is found, it is stored in the
variable z. The specified node is then removed from its original
location in the tree.

*The second step is to fix the double black node.* If the node to be
removed was black, it may disturb the properties of the red-black tree,
since all paths from the root to the leaves must contain the same number
of black nodes. To remedy this, the concept of a "double black" node is
introduced. If the node x _that replaced the deleted node is black, it
becomes a "double black" node._

*The third stage is the correction of the double black nodes.* To fix the
"double black" node, thefunctions _fixDoubleBlack (tree, x)_ and _fixDoubleBlackStep(tree, x)_ are called (Figures 8.39a,b). This feature fixes the "double black nodes" by using a series of rotations and recoloring steps. It considers several cases, depending on the colour of the brother of the "double black" node and its descendants. The function  _fixDoubleBlackStep (tree, x)_ handles all of these cases to ensure that the red-black tree remains balanced after each deletion operation (Table ).

The top diagram illustrates the replacement of node U (`9`) with subtree V (`7`) before calling `joinParentChild(tree, U, V)`.

Consider in more detail the different instances of the removal node in
the structure of the red-black tree. In the first step, the node is
removed simply as a node in the binary search tree. If the replacement
node is a "red" node, or if the removed node is a "red" node, the
removed node is replaced by another node. There is no need to make any
further changes to the tree structure (fig.8.37).

Figure 3.37. Deletion of red node (20)

If the node to be deleted and the node that replaces it are black nodes,
a situation called a "double black node" occurs. In this case, some
additional operations must be performed to ensure that the properties of
the red-black wood are preserved. The drakon- diagram algorithm of this
process is shown in Fig. 8.38.

If the replacement node is a leaf node (i.e., has no child nodes), we
replace the node with a "zero" leaf node and colour it black. If the
replacement node has one child node, we replace the node with its child
node and colour it black. If the replacement node has two child nodes, we
replace the node with its subsequent node in order, and then delete the
next node in order (which is no more than a node with one child node)
using the method described above.

If a node is deleted and replaced with another node, the properties of
the red-black wood may be compromised. To restore them, the following
operations must be performed:

[arabic]
. If the node to be deleted is red, the properties of the red-black tree
are not disturbed. If the replacement node is red, it should be
repainted black.

{empty}2. Next, rotate, recolour the nodes and/or transfer the
"blackness" (the number of black nodes relative to the red ones) up the
tree until the tree is balanced.

{empty}3. At the same time, you need to make sure that the root of the
tree is black.

Let's consider options for restoring the properties of red-black wood.
Enter the following notations: the node to be deleted is "x", the child
node of the deleted node is "y", and the sibling of the node to be
deleted is "s" (Figure 8.39).

Option 1: If the child element (y) of the node to be deleted (x) is
coloured red, then after deletion it should be recoloured black, as a
result of which the number of black nodes will be restored (Figure
8.40).

(y)

Option 2: When the sib(s) of the node to be deleted (x) is coloured
black, and at least one of the descendants is red, then four different
combinations are possible:

• Option 2(a): The brother(s) of the node to be deleted (x) is black. In
this case, the brother (s) is the left descendant of the parent (P), and
the left child of the brother is coloured red. This is the so-called
"left-left _configuration"_, in which the balance is achieved by the
right rotation, after which the colour of the child should be replaced by
black (Fig. 8.41).

Option 2(b): Mirror image of case 2(a). The "s" brother is his parent's
right child, and his right child is the red child. The right-right
configuration performs a left-hand rotation. The child node is then
changed to black. As a result, the black node counter property is
restored (Fig. 8.42).

Option 2 (c). The brother (s) of the remote node (y) is black. The
brother(s) is the left offspring of his parent, and his right child is
red. This is a left-to-right configuration, so a left rotation is
performed followed by a right rotation. The child node is coloured black
(Figure 8.43):

Figure 8.43. Left-Right node delete configuration

Option 2(d): The brother (s) of the remote node (y) is coloured black.
The brother (s) is the right child of his parent (P) and his left child
is the red child. A right-left rotation is then performed, followed by a
left-hand rotation. The colour of the child node changes to black (Fig.
8.44).image:media/image47.jpg[media/image47,width=670,height=121] Figure

Option H: If the node (y) to be removed and its brother(s) are coloured
black and both of its descendants are missing, i.e. black by definition,
then you need to recolour the children red and recursively add black to
the parent. If the parent was red, then it became black. If the parent
was black, it would become double black. If the parent is the root, then
it remains black. For example, below is a case where the node (y) to be
deleted and its brother (s) are black (Figure 8.45):

and (s)

Option 4: If the sib(s) of the node to be removed (y) is coloured red,
then a rotation is performed to achieve the balance of the tree. The
sister nodes are then repainted. For example, consider the following
option (Fig. 8.46):

Conclusion

Trees are one of the most important data structures in computer science,
used to represent hierarchical relationships and organize data. They
provide efficient search, insert, and delete operations, making them
ideal for use in a variety of applications.

AVL trees, named after their creators Adelsky-Velsky and Landis, are
balanced binary search trees. They provide fast search, insertion, and
deletion by keeping the height of the tree logarithmic relative to the
number of nodes. However, AVL trees require additional insertion and
deletion operations to maintain balance, which can be a disadvantage in
some applications.

Red-black trees are another type of balanced binary search trees. They
provide efficient search, insert, and delete operations, but can be more
difficult to implement because of the additional properties they must
support. They are widely used in many standard libraries.

The choice of a specific tree type depends on the specific requirements
of the application. AVL trees are generally preferred when frequent
searches are the most important operations, as they provide a more
stringent balance than red-black trees. On the other hand, red-and-black
trees can be more effective with frequent insertions and removals, as
they require fewer turns to maintain balance.

It's important to remember that both types of trees require additional
memory to store balance information, and both can be difficult to
implement. In some cases, other data structures, such as hash tables or
B-trees, may be more appropriate. However, despite these challenges,
trees continue to play a central role in computer science and are a key
tool for any programmer.
