=== 8.4 Red-black trees

==== 8.4.1. Properties of red-black trees

A red-black tree is a variant of a self-balancing binary search tree in
which the nodes are placed according to a certain rule and coloured red
or black (Figure 8.29)

Figure 8.29. Red-Black Tree

The nodes containing data (in this case, integers) are internal. In
addition, red-black trees contain imaginary, "null" nodes associated
with tree leaves (Null - in Figure 8.29). Red-black trees satisfy all
the properties of a binary search tree and must have the following
properties:

{empty}1. Each node is coloured red or black.

{empty}2. The root of the tree is always black.

{empty}3. All leaves are black (Null).

{empty}4. Both descendants of the red node are black, i.e. there cannot
be consecutive red nodes.

{empty}5. All simple paths from the node to the descending leaves
contain the same number of black nodes.

Unlike AVL trees, where balance is achieved by balancing the heights of
the left and right subtrees, red-black balance is achieved by the
properties mentioned above. Adding or removing a node from the red-black
tree can disrupt the red-black tree properties, and restoring balance is
achieved by two operations: repainting the nodes and/or rebuilding the
whole tree or its subtrees using specific rotations.The most important
of these properties are properties 4 and 5.

Property 4 dictates a critical aspect of red-black trees: the path from any given node to its deepest descendant must contain an equal number of red and black nodes. This isn't just an arbitrary rule; it's a fundamental mechanism for maintaining balance.

Property 5 builds on this by enforcing a uniform "black-height" for all paths from any node to its leaf descendants. Regardless of the specific path taken, the count of black nodes remains constant.

Black height is an important term used for red-black trees. This is the number of black nodes on any single path from node x (not including it) to the leaf. The black height of any node x is represented as a logarithm of the number of nodes in the tree. In particular, if in each branch from the root to the leaves the same number of black nodes, then the height of the tree will be equal to a logarithm of the number of nodes. This property allows you to quickly perform basic operations of the search tree, such as adding, removing and searching for a node.

To perform the above operations at the program level, a red-black tree is first created, for which two user types - node and RBTree are declared:
Node includes the following fields: `data` - node numeric value,  `colour` - node colour type bool: `red node` - TRUE; `black node` - false, `left`, `right` and `parent` nodes. In turn RBTree structure represents the reference type variable, that store objects containing not the "value" itself but a reference to the memory area where this object is stored (Fig. 8.30).

Next, consider the node positions in the tree as a result of each new
node insertion and determine which properties of the red-black tree are
violated. To understand this process, we introduce the following
notation: x - new node, P (Parent) - parent of node x, G (Grandparent) -
ancestor (parent of parent), U (Uncle) - uncle of node x, S - siblings (Figure 8.33).

To describe the process of balancing the red-black tree, enter the term cluster tree (tree-cluster) - a set of nodes involved in balancing.

To describe the process of balancing the red-black tree, let’s name the set of nodes involved in balancing _tree-cluster_ and enter a local syntax:
*:R or :B* is the color of the node. For example, P:R is the red parent.
*<= or =>* - the direction of the node position. For example, x <= P - the new node x is located to the left of the parent node P. 
The different instances of the red and black nodes are shown in the table
When a new element is inserted, it is assigned a red colour. To satisfy
the first two rules, it is sufficient to simply repaint the new vertices
in the desired colour. After each insertion, all these properties of the
red-black tree must be checked. If at least one property is not
satisfactory, the rotation and colour change operations are performed (Table ).

==== 8.4.3. Deleting a Node from a red-black tree

Removing a node from a RB tree is a complex process because
it depends on the location of the node, the presence of children, and
the colour of the nodes. It is important to remember that all
transformations of the tree structure must maintain its properties. The
DRAKON-diagram of the node removal algorithm is shown in Figures 8.38a,b. This
algorithm can be divided into three stages.

image::_images/Fig8_38b_deleteNode.jpg[width=75%]


[.text-center]
Figure 8.38. Node Deletion Algorithm (a -intellect map; b - DRAKON-diagram)

*The first step* is to delete the node. The algorithm traverses the
nodes of the red-black tree, moving left or right, depending on whether
the key of the current node is larger or smaller than the specified
value. When a node with the key key is found, it is stored in the
variable z. The specified node is then removed from its original
location in the tree.

*The second step is to fix the double black node.* If the node to be
removed was black, it may disturb the properties of the red-black tree,
since all paths from the root to the leaves must contain the same number
of black nodes. To remedy this, the concept of a "double black" node is
introduced. If the node x _that replaced the deleted node is black, it
becomes a "double black" node._

*The third stage is the correction of the double black nodes.* To fix the
"double black" node, thefunctions _fixDoubleBlack (tree, x)_ and _fixDoubleBlackStep(tree, x)_ are called (Figures 8.39a,b). This feature fixes the "double black nodes" by using a series of rotations and recoloring steps. It considers several cases, depending on the colour of the brother of the "double black" node and its descendants. The function  _fixDoubleBlackStep (tree, x)_ handles all of these cases to ensure that the red-black tree remains balanced after each deletion operation (Table ).

Consider in more detail the different instances of the removal node in
the structure of the red-black tree. In the first step, the node is
removed simply as a node in the binary search tree. If the replacement
node is a "red" node, or if the removed node is a "red" node, the
removed node is replaced by another node. There is no need to make any
further changes to the tree structure (Figure 8.37).

image::_images/Fig8_38b_deleteNode.jpg[width=75%]

Figure 3.37. Deletion of red node (20)

If the node to be deleted and the node that replaces it are black nodes,
a situation called a "double black node" occurs. In this case, some
additional operations must be performed to ensure that the properties of
the red-black wood are preserved. The drakon- diagram algorithm of this
process is shown in Fig. 8.38.

If the replacement node is a leaf node (i.e., has no child nodes), we
replace the node with a "zero" leaf node and colour it black. If the
replacement node has one child node, we replace the node with its child
node and colour it black. If the replacement node has two child nodes, we
replace the node with its subsequent node in order, and then delete the
next node in order (which is no more than a node with one child node)
using the method described above.

when removing "double black node"

If a node is deleted and replaced with another node, the properties of
the red-black wood may be compromised. To restore them, the following
operations must be performed:

[arabic]
. If the node to be deleted is red, the properties of the red-black tree
are not disturbed. If the replacement node is red, it should be
repainted black.

{empty}2. Next, rotate, recolour the nodes and/or transfer the
"blackness" (the number of black nodes relative to the red ones) up the
tree until the tree is balanced.

{empty}3. At the same time, you need to make sure that the root of the
tree is black.

Let's consider options for restoring the properties of red-black wood.
Enter the following notations: the node to be deleted is "x", the child
node of the deleted node is "y", and the sibling of the node to be
deleted is "s" (Figure 8.39).

image:media/image42.jpg[media/image42,width=280,height=174]

Figure 8.39. Tree node relationship

Option 1: If the child element (y) of the node to be deleted (x) is
coloured red, then after deletion it should be recoloured black, as a
result of which the number of black nodes will be restored (Figure
8.40).

image:media/image43.jpg[media/image43,width=332,height=144]

Fig. 8.40. Deleting and repainting the child of the node to be removed
(y)

Option 2: When the sib(s) of the node to be deleted (x) is coloured
black, and at least one of the descendants is red, then four different
combinations are possible:

• Option 2(a): The brother(s) of the node to be deleted (x) is black. In
this case, the brother (s) is the left descendant of the parent (P), and
the left child of the brother is coloured red. This is the so-called
"left-left _configuration"_, in which the balance is achieved by the
right rotation, after which the colour of the child should be replaced by
black (Fig. 8.41).

image:media/image44.jpg[media/image44,width=427,height=165]

Figure. 8.41. Left-Left node delete configuration

Option 2(b): Mirror image of case 2(a). The "s" brother is his parent's
right child, and his right child is the red child. The right-right
configuration performs a left-hand rotation. The child node is then
changed to black. As a result, the black node counter property is
restored (Fig. 8.42).

____

Option 2 (c). The brother (s) of the remote node (y) is black. The
brother(s) is the left offspring of his parent, and his right child is
red. This is a left-to-right configuration, so a left rotation is
performed followed by a right rotation. The child node is coloured black
(Figure 8.43):

image:media/image46.jpg[media/image46,width=670,height=121]

Figure 8.43. Left-Right node delete configuration

Option 2(d): The brother (s) of the remote node (y) is coloured black.
The brother (s) is the right child of his parent (P) and his left child
is the red child. A right-left rotation is then performed, followed by a
left-hand rotation. The colour of the child node changes to black (Fig.
8.44).image:media/image47.jpg[media/image47,width=670,height=121] Figure
8.44. Right-Left node delete configuration

Option H: If the node (y) to be removed and its brother(s) are coloured
black and both of its descendants are missing, i.e. black by definition,
then you need to recolour the children red and recursively add black to
the parent. If the parent was red, then it became black. If the parent
was black, it would become double black. If the parent is the root, then
it remains black. For example, below is a case where the node (y) to be
deleted and its brother (s) are black (Figure 8.45):

Figure 8.45 The Process of rebuilding a tree with two black nodes (y)
and (s)

Option 4: If the sib(s) of the node to be removed (y) is coloured red,
then a rotation is performed to achieve the balance of the tree. The
sister nodes are then repainted. For example, consider the following
option (Fig. 8.46):

Conclusion

Trees are one of the most important data structures in computer science,
used to represent hierarchical relationships and organize data. They
provide efficient search, insert, and delete operations, making them
ideal for use in a variety of applications.

AVL trees, named after their creators Adelsky-Velsky and Landis, are
balanced binary search trees. They provide fast search, insertion, and
deletion by keeping the height of the tree logarithmic relative to the
number of nodes. However, AVL trees require additional insertion and
deletion operations to maintain balance, which can be a disadvantage in
some applications.

Red-black trees are another type of balanced binary search trees. They
provide efficient search, insert, and delete operations, but can be more
difficult to implement because of the additional properties they must
support. They are widely used in many standard libraries.

The choice of a specific tree type depends on the specific requirements
of the application. AVL trees are generally preferred when frequent
searches are the most important operations, as they provide a more
stringent balance than red-black trees. On the other hand, red-and-black
trees can be more effective with frequent insertions and removals, as
they require fewer turns to maintain balance.

It's important to remember that both types of trees require additional
memory to store balance information, and both can be difficult to
implement. In some cases, other data structures, such as hash tables or
B-trees, may be more appropriate. However, despite these challenges,
trees continue to play a central role in computer science and are a key
tool for any programmer.
