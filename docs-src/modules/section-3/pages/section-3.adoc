== SECTION 3. Implementation of Basic Abstract Data Types in JavaScript

=== 3.1. Data Structuring Features

[abstract]
This section delves into the practical implementation of basic Abstract Data Types (ADTs) within the JavaScript programming language. ADTs, as mathematical models with defined operators, provide a foundation for algorithm development. However, translating these conceptual models into executable code requires representing ADTs using the data types and methods available in JavaScript. We will explore how to bridge the gap between abstract data structures and their concrete JavaScript implementations, demonstrating techniques to effectively utilize JavaScript's features to realize fundamental ADTs. This section will equip readers with the knowledge to translate theoretical ADT concepts into functional JavaScript code, laying the groundwork for more complex data structure and algorithm implementations.


In practical terms, the data structure is a collection of data
structured in such a way as to ensure their efficient use by users. This
requires a certain ordering of data, primarily at the level of storage
in computer memory. Reducing space and increasing its organization in
conjunction with reducing the time complexity of different tasks is the
main objective of working with data structures.

Considerable experience in the development of computer technology and
computing technology has made it possible to classify data structures
into different categories. First, **simple** and **integrated** structures are
distinguished by complexity. The criterion of simplicity is the
indivisibility of this, that is, in a computer implementation - a simple
chain of bits. Simple, basic structures include variables of different
types: integers, real numbers, logical, string.

Integrated (composite, complex) are data structures whose component
parts are other data structures, including simple and integrated. Many
basic integrated data structures are predefined by a specific
programming language: arrays, slices, structures, etc. Such structures
can be created by users for a specific problem, using basic integrated
structures.

By way of presentation, the data structures are divided into logical and
physical. The logical structure is an abstract data layout that the user
or programmer envisions. Physical structure is a method (schema) of
specific data placement in the memory of a computer. In general, the
logical and physical structures of the same data do not coincide. In a
logical (abstract) structure, data tend to be adjacent to each other,
while in a computer implementation these data may be located in
different memory regions.

An important feature of the data structure is the existence of links
between the elements of the structure. On this basis, disconnected and
connected are distinguished. Disconnected structures are characterized
by a lack of linkages between the elements of the structure, while
connected structures are characterized by linkages. Disjoint structures
include arrays, strings, stacks, queues, and connected lists. In many
cases, data can be characterized by variability, i.e., a change in the
number of elements and (or) the relationships between elements of the
structure. **Arrays, sets, records, tables** are under the category
of¬†**static data**, **stacks, queues, trees** - under the category of¬†semi
**static data**,**linked lists and graphs** - under the category of¬†**dynamic
data**.

Linear and non-linear data structures are distinguished in structure
order. Linear structures are divided into structures with sequential
distribution of elements in memory (**vectors, strings, arrays, stacks,
queues**) and structures with arbitrary connected distribution of
elements in memory, depending on the nature of the reciprocal
arrangement of elements in memory (simply connected and doubly connected
linear lists). Nonlinear structures are **multi-linked lists, trees,
graphs**.

One of the defining features of data structures is how to access data.
In the access method, a search mechanism is important - an algorithm
that determines the access path that is possible within a given memory
structure, and the number of steps along that path to find the data
sought. There are two main groups of data access methods: sequential and
direct.

**Sequential access** means that a group of elements is accessed in a
predefined ordered sequence. An example of sequential access is **single
linked list**. The various elements of the data structure are directly
accessed by providing a unique address for these elements.

Finally, one characteristic of data structures is homogeneity.
Homogeneous are structures that contain a set of simple data of the same
type (numeric, logical, string, etc.). Heterogeneous structures combine
data of different types. Examples of homogeneous structures are arrays,
slices, stacks. These structures include records and sets.

The presence of a large number of features of data structures
predetermined various attempts to classify them. From a programming
point of view, the main features are: linearity/non-linearity, data
access, homogeneity/heterogeneity of data. This section covers the
JS-implementation of linear abstract data such as **array/slice, map,
linked lists, stacks, and queues**.

=== 3.2. Linear data structures

Linear data structures are structures in which data elements are
arranged in sequence. Linear structures can be distinguished by the way
the individual elements of a data collection are accessed and by the
homogeneity of the data (homogeneous and heterogeneous).

==== 3.2.1. Arrays in JavaScript

An array is a collection of data, where each element is stored at a specific index. Arrays allow efficient storage and manipulation of multiple values in a single variable.

For example, the collection of integers [24, 12, 36, 6, 47, 11] forms an array (.Figure 3.1.).

[.text-center]
.Figure 3.1. One-dimensional array
image::{imagesdir}/Fig3_1_Array.jpg[width=400,height=200,align=center]
Declaring Arrays in JavaScript

JavaScript arrays are dynamic, meaning they can grow and shrink as needed. Unlike some other languages, JavaScript allows mixing different types within an array, but best practice is to keep arrays homogeneous (storing values of the same type).

üîπ Creating Arrays
Arrays in JavaScript can be declared in different ways:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Using [] (Recommended)

let numbers = [24, 12, 36, 6, 47, 11];

2Ô∏è‚É£ Using the Array Constructor
let numbers = new Array(24, 12, 36, 6, 47, 11);

This method is rarely used in modern JavaScript.

üîπ Multidimensional Arrays

JavaScript supports multidimensional arrays by storing arrays inside arrays.

let matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
];

console.log(matrix[1][2]); // Output: 6

Here, matrix[1][2] accesses the second row, third column (6).

To summarize

|===
| **Feature** | **JavaScript Equivalent**
| **Declaring an array** | **let arr = [item1, item2, ...];**
| **Using the Array constructor** | **let arr = new Array(item1, item2, ...);**
| **Accessing elements** | **arr[index]**
| **Multidimensional arrays** | **let matrix = [[...], [...]];**
|===


==== 3.2.2. Slices

A slice is a variable-length data collection that stores elements of a homogeneous type. A slice can be thought of as a "slice" of an array. Slice syntax in JavaScript (T - data type): **[]** or **[value1, value2, value3, ..., valueN]**.

In JavaScript, slices are implemented dynamically. To create a slice (array) in JavaScript, you can use an array literal or the **Array** constructor. For example, creating **parentSlice** would look like this:

[source, javascript]
----
let parentSlice = new Array(20).fill(0); // Creating an array of 20 elements, filled with zeros
----
[.text-center]
.Figure 3.2. Create different slices **sliceA** and **sliceB**
image::{imagesdir}/Fig3_2_Slice.jpg[width=600,height=200,align=center]

The **length** property indicates the number of elements in the slice (array). In JavaScript there is no explicit concept of "capacity". Multiple "slices" can be created from a single array using the **slice()** method or destructuring. For example, to create **sliceA** and **sliceB** from **parentSlice**:

[source, javascript]
----
let sliceA = parentSlice.slice(0, 4); // sliceA contains the first 5 elements
let sliceB = parentSlice.slice(12, 14); // sliceB contains 3 elements from index 12 to 14
----

In JavaScript, **sliceA** will contain elements from index 0 to 4, and **sliceB** will contain elements from index 12 to 13.

The following functions and methods are used to work with slices (arrays) in JavaScript:

. **push()**: Adds elements to the end of the array. If the array size is insufficient, it automatically increases.
. **length**: Property that returns the number of elements in the array.
. **slice()**: Creates a new array containing a "slice" of the original array.

==== 3.2.3. Objects in JavaScript

In JavaScript, objects serve the same purpose as structures in other programming languages. They allow us to store multiple related values (properties) in a single entity. Objects in JavaScript are flexible and support various ways of creation and manipulation.

JavaScript objects are defined using curly braces {} and consist of key-value pairs.

üîπ Creating an Object with named properties

[source, javascript]
----
let employee1 = {
    firstName: "Peter",
    lastName: "Wolf",
    age: 35,
    salary: 20000
};

console.log("Employee 1:", employee1);
----

üîπ Alternative Way. Object Constructor

Another way to create an object is by using the Object constructor.

[source, javascript]
----
let employee2 = new Object();
employee2.firstName = "Nick";
employee2.lastName = "Smith";
employee2.age = 49;
employee2.salary = 35000;

console.log("Employee 2:", employee2);
----

Key Differences:

‚úÖ The first approach (object literal {}) is more common and recommended.
‚úÖ The second approach (new Object()) is used when objects need to be created dynamically.

üîπ Creating an object with a _factory function_

A _factory function_ is a regular function that creates and returns an _object_.

[source, javascript]
----
function createEmployee(firstName, lastName, age, salary) {
    return {
        firstName,
        lastName,
        age,
        salary
    };
}

let emp1 = createEmployee("Peter", "Wolf", 35, 20000);
let emp2 = createEmployee("Nick", "Smith", 49, 35000);

console.log("Employee 1:", emp1);
console.log("Employee 2:", emp2);
----

Output:

Employee 1: { firstName: 'Peter', lastName: 'Wolf', age: 35, salary: 20000 }

Employee 2: { firstName: 'Nick', lastName: 'Smith', age: 49, salary: 35000 }

üîπ Adding methods to a factory function

An object can contain methods (functions inside the object).

[source, javascript]
----
function createEmployee(firstName, lastName, age, salary) {
    return {
        getFullName: () => **${firstName} ${lastName}**,
        getSalary: () => salary,  // You can read salary
        setSalary: (newSalary) => salary = newSalary // You can change salary
    };
}

let emp5 = createEmployee("Bob", "Anderson", 50, 30000);

console.log(emp5.getFullName()); // "Bob Anderson"
console.log(emp5.getSalary());   // 30000

emp5.setSalary(35000);
console.log(emp5.getSalary());   // 35000
----

Output:

Bob Anderson
30000
35000

==== 3.2.3. Map in JavaScript

In JavaScript, Maps are collections that store unordered key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a corresponding value. Maps are particularly useful in data retrieval algorithms because they offer efficient lookups.

Unlike arrays, which use numeric indexes, Maps allow keys of any data type, making them more flexible (.Figure 3.3.). 

[.text-center]
.Figure 3.3. Map
image::_images/Fig3_3_Map.jpg[width=400,height=200,align=center]

In JavaScript, we use the Map object to create a map. The syntax is:

[source, javascript]
----
let myMap = new Map();
----

Here, **myMap** is an empty **Map** ready to store key-value pairs.

üîπTo declare _a map_ where keys are strings and values are numbers, we use the **.set()** method:

[source, javascript]
----
let studentScores = new Map();

studentScores.set("Alice", 95);
studentScores.set("Bob", 88);
studentScores.set("Charlie", 92);

console.log(studentScores);
----

Now, **studentScores** contains:

"Alice" ‚Üí 95
"Bob" ‚Üí 88
"Charlie" ‚Üí 92

üîπAccessing Values in a _Map_

To retrieve a value from a map, use **.get(key)**:
[source, javascript]
----
console.log(studentScores.get("Alice")); // Output: 95
console.log(studentScores.get("Bob"));   // Output: 88
----

If the key does not exist, **.get()** returns undefined.

==== 3.3.1. Linked List

A linked list is a dynamic data structure where each element, called a node, consists of two parts (.Figure 3.3.):

[.text-center]
.Figure 3.4. Simply linked list structure
image::_images/Fig3_4_LL.jpg[width=70%, height=30%, align=center]

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data (which can be any primitive or complex data type).

2Ô∏è‚É£ A reference (pointer) to the next node in the list.

Unlike arrays, where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, linked lists store elements at different memory addresses and connect them via references.

They are widely used in memory management, file systems, and queue implementations.


In JavaScript, we represent a linked list node using an object.

üîπ Creating a Node

[source, javascript]
----
function createNode(data) {
    return {
        data,
        next: null
    };
}
----

Each node has:
‚úÖ data ‚Äì stores the value.
‚úÖ next ‚Äì stores the reference to the next node (initially null).

üîπ Creating a Linked List 
A linked list needs:
1Ô∏è‚É£ A reference to the first node (head).
2Ô∏è‚É£ A counter (size) to track the number of elements.

[source, javascript]
----
function createLinkedList() {
    return {
        head: null,
        size: 0
    };
}
----
Here _head_ points to the first node, _size_ stores the length of the list.

==== 3.2.4. Stack and Queue as data structures

a) Stack

A stack is an abstract data type that contains elements with two basic
operations:_Push_, which adds an item to the collection, and _Pop_,
which deletes the last item added. From a technological point of view, a stack is a
memory, in which the values of the data are loaded and retrieved
according to the _"**last in - first out**" (LIFO - Last-In-First-Out)_
strategy. Data enters the stack from only one side, called the top of
the stack (.Figure 3.5.).

[.text-center]
.Figure 3.5. _Last-in, first-out_ stack work
image::_images/Fig3_5_Stack.jpg[width=70%, height=40%, align=center]
A stack supports two primary operations:

**Push(item)** ‚Äì adds an element to the top of the stack.
**Pop()** ‚Äì removes the top element from the stack.

From a conceptual point of view, a stack can be compared to a stack of plates:

You can only remove the top plate. To access a plate further down, you must remove all plates above it.

This structure is commonly used in:

‚úÖ Undo (Ctrl+Z) functionality in text editors.

‚úÖ Managing function calls in recursion (function calls are stored in a stack).

üîπDeclaring a Stack in JavaScript

JavaScript does not have a built-in stack data type, but it can be implemented using arrays, as they provide **push()** and **pop()** methods.


[source, javascript]
----
function createStack() {
    let data = []; // Internal storage for stack elements

    return {
        push(item) {
            data.push(item);
        },

        pop() {
            if (data.length === 0) return undefined;
            return data.pop();
        },

        peek() {
            return data[data.length - 1]; // View the top element
        },

        size() {
            return data.length;
        },

        isEmpty() {
            return data.length === 0;
        }
    };
}
----

b) Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the _First-In-First-Out_ (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed (.Figure 3.6.).

[.text-center]
.Figure 3.6. _First-In-First-Out_ queue work 
image::_images/Fig3_6_Queue.jpg[width=70%, height=40%, align=center]

A queue supports two primary operations:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **enqueue(item)** ‚Äì Adds an element to the back of the queue.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **dequeue()** ‚Äì Removes an element from the front of the queue.

Queues are widely used in:

‚úÖ Task scheduling (CPU scheduling, print queue).

‚úÖ Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms.

‚úÖ Message processing systems.


==== 3.2.5. Representation of binary trees in JavaScript

Binary trees as an abstract data type were discussed in the first
section, here we will talk about the computer implementation of this
type of data structures using the visual algorithmic language DRAKON and
the programming language Golang. Before we continue, let's review the key 
terms associated with binary trees (.Figure 3.7.).

[.text-center]
.Figure 3.7. Basic terminology of the tree
image::_images/Fig3_7_Term.jpg[width=70%, height=40%, align=center]

_Root:_ The root of the tree is the only node with no incoming edges. It
is the top node in the tree;

_Node:_ This is the basic element of the tree. Each node has data and
two references that can point to zero or its descendants;

_Edge:_ This is also the fundamental part of the tree and is used to 
connect the two node points.

_Path:_ A path is an ordered list of nodes connected by edges.

_Leaf:_ A leaf node is a node that has no descendants.

_Tree height:_ The height of a tree is the number of edges on the
longest path between the root and the leaf.

_Node level:_ Node level is the number of edges on the path from the
root node of this node.

The binary tree‚Äôs information structure is set up as follows: (Figure
3.8.):

[.text-center]
.Figure 3.8 Binary tree structure (_info_ - value (key), (N - NULL))
image::_images/Fig3_8_BST.jpg[width=50%, height=30%, align=center]

The declaration of the basic elements of binary trees in the JavaScript language is conveniently performed using the **factory function**:

[source, javascript]
----
function createNode(value) {
    return {
        value,
        left: null,
        right: null
    };
}
----

Each node has:

‚úÖ value ‚Äì Stores the data.

‚úÖ left ‚Äì Reference to the left child (initially null).

‚úÖ right ‚Äì Reference to the right child (initially null).


The binary tree should have:

1Ô∏è‚É£ A reference to the root node.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Methods to insert values into the tree.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Methods to traverse the tree.

The structure of a binary tree in the Script language is declared in a simplified way:
[source, javascript]
----
function createTreeNode(value, parent) {
  return {
    left: null,
    right: null,
    parent: parent,
    value: value,
  };
}
----

Several types of binary trees are discussed in the training literature,
the most important of which is classification based on node values:

* a binary search tree (BST);
* AVL-Tree;
* Red-Black tree.

. Binary search Tree

**Node Structure:**

Each node has a value, a left child, and a right child.

In JavaScript, this can be represented with objects.

**Insertion:**

New nodes are placed based on their value relative to the current node.

Smaller values go left, larger values go right.

. AVL-Tree

**Self-Balancing:**

* Maintains balance by ensuring the height difference between left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.

*Balancing Mechanism:*

Uses rotations (single and double) to restore balance after insertions or deletions.

*Implementation Notes:*

Requires tracking node heights and implementing rotation functions.

. Red-Black Tree

**Self-Balancing:**

Uses color attributes (red or black) for nodes and follows specific rules to maintain balance.
Rules:

‚úÖ Root and leaves are black.

‚úÖ Red nodes have black children.

‚úÖ All paths from a node to its descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.

*Balancing Mechanism:*

Uses recoloring and rotations to restore balance after modifications.

*Performance:*

Often faster than AVL trees for insertions and deletions.

*Implementation Notes:*

Requires tracking node colors and implementing recoloring and rotation functions.

Algorithms implementing the basic tree manipulation functions are presented in Section 8.

==== 3.2.6. Representation of Graphes in JavaScript

Recall that a graph G is given by a set of vertices \{V} and a set of
edges \{E} connecting all or part of these vertices. Thus, a graph G is
completely defined as \{V, E}. 

Types of Graphs (.Figure 3.9):

1Ô∏è‚É£ Undirected Graph ‚Äì Edges have no direction (e.g., friendships in social media).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Directed Graph (Digraph) ‚Äì Edges have direction (e.g., roads, dependencies).

[.text-center]
.Figure 3.9. The view of a) -undirected; b) - directed graph
image::_images/Fig3_9_Graphes.jpg[width=70%, height=40%, align=center]

üîπ Graph Representation in JavaScript

A graph can be represented using an adjacency list, where:

Each node (vertex) stores a list of neighbors.

Directed graphs store one-way connections.

Undirected graphs store two-way connections.

üîπ Creating a Graph in JavaScript

We will use a factory function to create a graph.

[source, javascript]
----

function createGraph(isDirected = false) {
    let adjacencyList = new Map();

    function addVertex(vertex) { // adds a new node
        if (!adjacencyList.has(vertex)) {
            adjacencyList.set(vertex, []);
        }
    }

    function addEdge(vertex1, vertex2) { // connects two nodes
        if (!adjacencyList.has(vertex1)) {
            addVertex(vertex1);
        }
        if (!adjacencyList.has(vertex2)) {
            addVertex(vertex2);
        }
        adjacencyList.get(vertex1).push(vertex2);
        
        if (!isDirected) {
            adjacencyList.get(vertex2).push(vertex1);
        }
    }

    function getAdjacencyList() { // returns the full graph structure
        return adjacencyList;
    }

    return { addVertex, addEdge, getAdjacencyList };
}
----

Algorithms implementing the basic tree manipulation functions are presented in Section 9.
