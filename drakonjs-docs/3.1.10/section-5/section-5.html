<h3 id="_5_1_requirements_for_algorithms"><a class="anchor" href="#_5_1_requirements_for_algorithms"></a>5.1 Requirements for algorithms</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The previous sections focused on the description of the most common data
structures, on the one hand as abstract entities, and on the other -
their concrete implementation in the programming language JavaScript. This
section will deal with the theoretical analysis of algorithms for
processing data structures from the perspective of estimating the time
spent on program code execution and computer memory usage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In theory and in practice, data structure processing algorithms are
defined as a set of sequentially performed, stable procedures that
provide a final computational result based on a fixed and limited set of
source data. Most data processing algorithms include basic data
processing procedures such as searching, sorting, adding, updating,
deleting, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Foremost, it should be noted that a &#8220;good algorithm&#8221; must have two
characteristics: a) correctness and b) finality. <em>Correctness</em> means
that if an algorithm is designed to solve a particular problem, it must
always produce the correct result for all the source data and no input
data will get the wrong result. The <em>finiteness</em> of the algorithm means
that a finite number of computational operations must be performed to
obtain the result, i.e.Â the execution of the program code must stop at
some point in time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the algorithm is correct and finite, the most important
characteristic of the algorithm is efficiency, which is achieved by
meeting the following requirements:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The algorithm should effectively use the resources available to the
system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The computational time (time taken to generate an output data
corresponding to a particular input ones) should be minimal;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The memory used by the algorithm should also be as small as possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most computational tasks, it is necessary to strive for a compromise
between computation time and occupied memory. In other words, when
choosing a method for solving a computational problem, you need to
decide on priorities: what is more important - the computation time or
the amount of memory occupied. It may seem that this is not so important
for modern computers. However, when solving complex problems associated
with the processing of huge amounts of data, for example, for artificial
intelligence problems or for bioinformatics problems (for example,
genome decoding), the search for the optimal combination of computing
time and computer memory becomes decisive. In this regard, we will
define the term &#8220;algorithm complexity&#8221; as a measure of the amount of
time and/or space required to solve a problem, depending on the size of
the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Such analysis involves determining a function that links the length of
the input data of the algorithm to the time it takes (its <em>time
complexity</em>) or the number of storage locations it uses (<em>the complexity
of the space</em>). The algorithm is considered effective when the values of
this function are either negligible or slowly increasing relative to the
size of the input data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_5_2_theoretical_analysis_of_algorithm_complexity"><a class="anchor" href="#_5_2_theoretical_analysis_of_algorithm_complexity"></a>5.2. Theoretical analysis of algorithm complexity</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately, the created algorithms must be implemented on some computing
device using the generated program code. Therefore, one should
distinguish between the complexity of the algorithm itself and the
complexity of its computer implementation. The fastest algorithm
implemented on a slow computing device may be less efficient than a less
successful algorithm implemented on a computer with more processing
power or a programming language capable of parallel computing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, when assessing the complexity of the algorithms, they are carried
out on an abstract machine with random access to memory, which makes it
possible not to take into account the low-level parameters of the
computing device (processor memory size, multitasking, etc.). The model
of such a machine consists of memory and a processor, which work as
follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>memory consists of cells, each of which has an address and can store
one data element;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>each memory call takes one unit of time, regardless of the number of
the addressable cell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the amount of memory is sufficient to execute any algorithm;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the processor performs any elementary operation in one time step;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loops and functions are not considered elementary operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The complexity of the <em>Tn</em> algorithm associated with estimates of
its complexity is determined by counting the number of operations
performed. For example, consider the algorithm for finding the maximum
element of an array.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-javascript hljs" data-lang="javascript">const array = [11, 9, 17, 45, 411];
let maxNumber = array[0];

for (let index = 1; index &lt; array.length; index++) {
    if (array[index] &gt; maxNumber) {
        maxNumber = array[index];
    }
}

console.log("The largest value of an array element =", maxNumber);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When implementing this algorithm, the following will be performed:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>(N - 1) the operation of assigning a new value to the loop counter i;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(N - 1) the operation of comparing the counter with the value N;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(N - 1) the operation of comparing an array element with the value of maxNumber;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from 1 to N operations of assigning a value to the variable maxNumber.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is obvious that such a calculation for determining the complexity of
the algorithm and estimating its complexity is individual and depends on
the size of the input data. Therefore, it was quite natural to propose a
qualitative assessment of complexity: depending on the &#8220;quality&#8221; of
the initial data: the best option, the worst and the average.</p>

<h3 id="_5_3_complexity_qualitative_assessment"><a class="anchor" href="#_5_3_complexity_qualitative_assessment"></a>5.3. Complexity qualitative assessment</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Asymptotic notations such as omega-notation, theta-notation, and Big-O
notation that reflect the three time bounds of the algorithm (lower,
middle, and upper) are used to quantify the complexity of algorithms.
Omega notation is the lower bound of the algorithmâs running time, which
characterizes the best algorithm complexity in terms of achieving
efficiency. For any value of n of the source data, the minimum time
required by the algorithm is set to Î©(f(n)).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Big-O notation represents the upper bound on the execution time of
the algorithm, which characterizes the worst complexity of the algorithm
in terms of efficiency. In most practical cases, this notation is used
to evaluate the effectiveness of algorithms, since it is the worst-case
scenario of the computational process that the software developer must
evaluate. Finally, theta notation (Î-notation) is an upper and lower
bound on the execution time of algorithms and is used to analyze their
average complexity. Consider in more detail the Big O notation that
determines the upper bound of any algorithm, that is, the algorithm
cannot take longer than the upper bound.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To begin with the simplest time-constant algorithm is an algorithm that
requires the same amount of time, regardless of its input data, whose
complexity is denoted as O(1). For example, given two numbers, you need
to calculate the sum. This is followed by the logarithmic time
complexity O(log n). When the time taken by the algorithm is
proportional to the logarithm of input size n, it is said to have
logarithmic time complexity. An example is the simple calculation of the
number of print operations of the index cycle:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-javascript hljs" data-lang="javascript">let n = 16;
for (let i = 1; i &lt; n; i *= 2) {
    console.log("i = ", i);
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recall that logâ 16  = logâ 2^4 = 4 logâ 2 = 4, since
logâ 2 = 1. Algorithms with logarithmic complexity are
considered highly efficient because the ratio of execution time of one
operation to the size of the data array decreases with its increasing
size. Algorithms that work in logarithmic time are usually found in
binary tree operations or binary search operations. Such algorithms will
be discussed in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Linear time complexity (O) characterizes algorithms whose execution time
linearly depends on the size of the input data (n). The simplest example
is the problem of computing the sum of n numbers:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-javascript hljs" data-lang="javascript">let n = 16;
let sum = 0;

for (let i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
    sum += i;
}

console.log("sum =", sum);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typical examples of linear time complexity are algorithms associated
with arrays sorting, which will be shown in the next section. It is
important to note that linear complexity algorithms do not require
additional memory. This is followed by the quadratic complexity of O(n2)
algorithms, the number of operations in which is quadratic depending on
the size of the input data. As an example we can give the algorithm of
multiplication of two numbers in the interval <em>[1:n;1:m]:</em></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-javascript hljs" data-lang="javascript">let n = 3;
let m = 5;
let pow = 1;

for (let i = 1; i &lt; n; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j &lt; m; j++) {
        pow = pow * i * j;
    }

<p>As shown in this table and graph, as the complexity of the function
increases, the number of computations or the time required to perform
the function can increase significantly. Next, the algorithms will be
described with estimates of their complexity. Another characteristic of
the computational complexity of algorithms is the spatial complexity,
estimated by the amount of memory required by the algorithm in its life
cycle. This space consists of fixed and variable parts. A
fixed part is the space required to store simple variables and
constants, as well as the program size, which is independent of the
complexity of the task. A part variable is the space required by
variables, the size of which depends entirely on the size of the task.
For example, recursion stack space, dynamic memory allocation, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spatial complexity is evaluated as O(1) if only the input data set is
used. If the problem requires an auxiliary memory of the same size as
the input memory (the memory to store the original array), then the
spatial complexity is evaluated as O(n2).</p>

<p>It is especially important to know whether the variety used is stable. Especially in
situations where your data already has some order that you
would like to support when you sort them with a different key

Student data, which is sorted by name by default. You also
would like to sort it into classes while maintaining an orderly order
Names.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, the stability of the sorting does not matter,
when the sorting keys of objects in a collection are the objects themselves - the array
integers or strings, for example, because we cannot determine
the difference between duplicate keys.</p>
