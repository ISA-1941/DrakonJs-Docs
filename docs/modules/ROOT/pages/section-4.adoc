== SECTION 4. DRAKON - Visual Algorithmic Language 

[Abstract]
This section explores the application of DrakonTech, a visual programming technology, to the design and implementation of data structures and algorithms. We will demonstrate how DrakonTech's graphical approach simplifies the representation of complex algorithmic logic, making it easier to understand, develop, and maintain efficient data structures and algorithms. We will cover the core principles of DrakonTech and illustrate its use in solving common algorithmic challenges, emphasizing its ability to enhance code clarity and reduce errors.

=== 4.1. Algorithm representation visualization

==== 4.1.1. Methods of visualization of algorithms

In theory and practice the following forms of representation of algorithms have been formed: 

•	Words (written in natural language);
•	Visual (images from graphic characters);
•	Pseudocodes (semiformalized descriptions of algorithms in conditional algorithmic language);
•	Software (programming language texts).

Visual representations of algorithms were the most effective and common in terms of visualization and understanding. Conceptually, visualization is a form of presentation of information, data, knowledge in the form of images, in order to achieve maximum convenience of perception, understanding and analysis. The visual representation allows a better view and understanding of the structural elements used in the design of the algorithm, including the logic of their interaction. The most common means of visualizing algorithmic constructions are flowcharts and Drakon-diagrams. The advantage of flowcharting is the availability of a corresponding State standard. However, flowcharts have recently been criticized: they claim that they are unsuitable for structural programming, difficult to formalize, they cannot be used to generate the programming code.

An alternative to flowchart imaging is Drakon-based algorithm engineering, which results in Drakon-diagrams. Drakon-diagrams are suitable for formalized recording, automatic code retrieval and execution on the computer. However, a more important aspect of Drakon technology is its cognitive difference from flowchart technology. While flowcharts do improve programm clarity, this is not always the case, and improvements are limited. In addition, there are many cases when unsuccessful flowcharts confuse the case and make understanding difficult. In contrast, Drakon-diagrams are much better understood (Figure 4.1.).

==== 4.1.2. Algorithmic language Drakon

Drakon.Tech is a visual programming language with a strong emphasis on clarity and understandability, which makes it particularly well-suited for developing algorithmic thinking. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and potential:

**Purpose:**

* **Improving Algorithm Comprehension:**
    * Drakon-technology uses visual diagrams to represent algorithms, making them easier to grasp than traditional text-based code.
    * This visual approach helps to clarify the flow of logic and the relationships between different parts of an algorithm.
* **Enhancing Communication:**
    * The standardized visual language facilitates communication between developers, as well as between developers and non-technical stakeholders.
    * This is especially valuable in complex projects where clear communication is essential.
* **Increasing Software Reliability:**
    * By promoting clear and structured algorithms, Drakon-technology helps to reduce errors and improve the reliability of software.
    * This is particularly important in critical applications, such as those in aerospace or medical fields.
* **Facilitating Learning:**
    * Drakon-technology serves as an excellent tool for teaching and learning programming concepts, as it helps to visualize abstract ideas.

**Potential for Developing Algorithmic Thinking:**

* **Visualizing Logic:**
    * The visual nature of Drakon.Tech allows users to see the logical flow of an algorithm, which helps to develop their ability to think logically and systematically.
* **Structuring Problems:**
    * Visual language Drakon encourages users to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps, which is a fundamental aspect of algorithmic thinking.
* **Identifying Patterns:**
    * By visualizing algorithms, users can more easily identify patterns and recurring structures, which can lead to more efficient and elegant solutions.
* **Debugging and Problem-Solving:**
    * The visual representation of algorithms makes it easier to identify and correct errors, which helps to develop problem-solving skills.
* **Abstraction:**
    * Drakon helps to teach abstraction, by allowing people to look at the overall flow of a process, without neccessarily having to focus on the small granular details of every step.

In essence, Drakon's strength lies in its ability to bridge the gap between abstract algorithmic concepts and concrete visual representations. This makes it a valuable tool for anyone seeking to develop their algorithmic thinking skills.

=== 4.1.3. DrakonTech - JavaScript implementation of Drakon-technology 

    •   Visual Development with Flowcharts

DrakonTech allows you to build programs by creating flowcharts. Each flowchart becomes a JavaScript function. This visual approach ensures you can still understand your program even years later.

    • Readable and Standardized Diagrams

Drakon flowcharts are based on a strict aerospace-industry standard that ensures your diagrams are clean, consistent, and free of visual noise. You don’t need to know the standard—DrakonTech automatically ensures your diagrams adhere to it.

    • Intuitive and Efficient Editing

Forget traditional, cumbersome diagramming software. With DrakonTech, creating and modifying flowcharts is quick and easy. A few clicks are all it takes to build even the most advanced algorithms.

    • Advanced Features for Modern Development

DrakonTech’s code generator supports:

• modules;

• functions;

• object-oriented programming;

• finite automata (finite-state machines);

• backward chaining.


== 4.2. Interface of Drakon.Tech 
 
 Interface of Drakon.Tech is designed with a focus on visual clarity and ease of use. Here's a general overview (Figure 4.2.): 

image::Fig4_2_InterfaceDrakonTech.jpg[width=600,height=300,align=center]
[.text-center]
Figure 4.2. DrakonTech Interface

=== 4.2.1. Core Principles:

*Visual Flow:*

The primary focus is on a graphical workspace where users construct algorithms using visual icons and connecting lines. This emphasizes the flow of control and data.   

*Simplified Icons:*

Drakon uses a limited set of standardized icons, each representing a specific action or decision. This keeps the diagrams clean and easy to interpret.

*Structured Layout:*

The language enforces a structured layout, which helps to maintain consistency and readability. This is a key feature that distinguishes Drakon from free-form flowcharting tools.   

=== 4.2.2. Typical Interface Elements:

*Canvas/Workspace:*

This is the central area where users create and edit Drakon diagrams.
Users can drag and drop icons, connect them with lines, and add text labels.

*Icon Palette/Toolbar:*
This provides access to the various Drakon icons, such as:
• Start and End points.
• Action boxes.
• Decision diamonds.
• Loop structures.

*Properties/Inspector Panel:*

This panel allows users to modify the properties of selected icons, such as:
• Text labels.
• Conditions for decision points.
• Data values.

*Code Generation/Output Panel:*
In Drakon.Tech, which is designed for code generation, this area displays the generated code in the target programming language (e.g., JavaScript).

*Navigation and Zoom Controls:*
These allow users to navigate large diagrams and zoom in or out for detailed editing.

Key Characteristics:

    * Clarity::
        The interface is designed to minimize visual clutter and maximize the clarity of the algorithm.

    * Efficiency::
        The tools and layout are optimized for efficient diagram creation and editing.

    * Standardization::
        The interface adheres to the Drakon language's standards, ensuring consistent and understandable diagrams.

In summary, the Drakon.Tech interface prioritizes visual communication and structured algorithm representation, making it a valuable tool for both programming and conceptual understanding.

== 4.3. Creating a Drakon-diagram

Web application _DrakonTech_ provides for the creation of two types of Drakon-diagrams, the choice of ones is determined by the complexity of the algorithm (Figure4.3.):

[.text-center]
b) Silhuette

[.text-center]
Figure 4.3. Two types of Drakon-diagrams

To create a Drakon-diagram, the user chooses the necessary icons, filling them with the corresponding operators of the JavaScript programming language (Figure 4.4).

image::Fig4_4_icons.jpg[width=500,height=200,align=center]
[.text-center]
Figure 4.4.  Set of DrakonTech icons

Creating a Drakon-diagram must follow certain rules:
The selected icon is moved by the mouse to the vertical line (skewer -
in terms of Drakon-technology) in the right place. Creating a Drakon-diagram must follow
certain rules:

[arabic]
. Creating a Drakon-diagram begins with a name that should reflect the
purpose of the (function) algorithm and be located at the top.
. The diagram should have only one beginning and one end. The "`end`"
graph is placed at the bottom of the diagram (Figure 4.5):

image::Fig4_5_BeginEnd.jpg[width=150,height=100,align=center]

[.text-center]
Figure 4.5. Diagram start/end

[arabic, start=3]
. The action flow represented in the diagram should only go from top to
bottom. This approach is more convenient, because in our cultural area
texts are read in this way.
. Avoid turning. The only case where lines have to change direction is
where decisions are made. Turns are needed only when the algorithm
requires making a choice between different actions. If there are no
solutions, you need to go down. In any case, it is necessary to minimize
the number of turns.
. Crossings of lines are absolutely not allowed. All attempts to apply
crossings must be prevented. However, in case of an intersection, the
editor will give an error.
. A top-down action prevents the use of arrows. The only exception is a
loop of type while (Figure 4.6.):

image::Fig4_6_While.jpg[width=200,height=100,align=center]

[.text-center]
Figure 4.6. While loop type

[arabic, start=7]
. When creating a Drakon-diagram, only straight vertical and horizontal
lines should be used, as straight lines are easier to understand than
curves.
. The distance between icons is set automatically.
. Branching is done only to the right. Branching to the left should be
excluded. Following this rule significantly increases the predictability
and uniformity of charts.
. For convenience, the dragon diagram can be moved around the work area using "_Shift + mouse wheel_" (horizontally) and using the _mouse wheel_ (vertically).

The reader may get the impression that creating Drakon-diagrams is a
very complex process. It should be recalled once again that in the
editor DrakonTech everything is quite simple and clear. The
editor will not allow the violation of the stated rules, which is
checked by the verify option.

=== 4.4. Basic structures of Drakon algorithms

==== 4.4.1. Linear structure

The linear structure of an algorithmic process implements operations
that are performed sequentially in order of writing. A typical example
of such a process is a standard three-step computing scheme:

[loweralpha]
a) Input data; 

b) formula calculation; 

c) output result. 

The graphical representation of the basic element of the linear structure in JavaScript is in the form of simple rectangles (Figure 4.7.).

image::Fig4_7_Linear.jpg[width=300,height=200,align=center]

[.text-center]
Figure 4.7. Linear structure of Drakon-diagram

==== 4.4.2. Basic structures of branched structure

The branched structure contains at least one condition check, which
ensures the transition to one of the possible solutions. Each option
leads to a common output, that is, the algorithm will continue
regardless of which path is chosen. The branching structure exists in
two main options:

a). The Drakon-snippet of the construction "`if (condition), then
(action) otherwise (action)`", that is, in programming languages is the
statement _if...else_. An example of an _if-else_ construction in a
Drakon-diagram in an algorithm for finding minimum and maximum array
values (Figure 4.8):

image::Fig4_8_ifelse.jpg[width=200,height=100,align=center]

[.text-center]
Figure 4.8. Diagram-snippet with if-else

b). Drakon-snippet construction «Select»

The values to which the expression in the "`Choose`" graph will be
compared are covered in the "`Option`" graphs. If there is no text in
the extreme right, it means "`all other values`". Below is an example of
how to branch a sorting algorithm (merge sort) (4.9).

image::Fig4_9_Select.jpg[width=800,height=400,align=center]

[.text-center]
Figure 4.9. Branch selection snippet (Select statement)

==== 4.4.3. Base loop constructions

The loop structure involves repeating the same sequence of actions
repeatedly. The number of repetitions is determined by the input data or
task conditions. Loop structures include, first of all, the construction
"`Loop-For`" (C-style loop, "`Loop for each`", composite constructions
"`Loop-With_Arrow`" ("`Do-Chek loop`") and "`Do-Chek-Do`").

a). "`Loop-For`" consists of three parts. In the first part, the loop
initialization is fixed. In the second one, the loop completion
condition is checked. If true, the body operators of the loop are
executed until the expression becomes false. If it is false, the loop
ends and the control is passed to the next operator. In the third part,
the loop parameter increases. The snippet of the Drakon-diagram with the
"Loop-For" design has the appearance (Figure 4.10):

image::Fig4_10_forCycle.jpg[width=300,height=200,align=center]

[.text-center]
Figure 4.10. Drakon-construction "`Loop-For`"

b). Loop "`foreach`" executes the operator or block of operators for
each array element or data list (4.11):

[.text-center]
Figure 4.11. Drakon-construction "`Loop for each`"

c). Example of composite construction "`Loop With Arrow`" (Figure 4.12).

=== 4.5. From Drakon-diagram to program code

Each Drakon-diagram corresponds to the program module. Figure 4.19 shows
the structure of the array sorting algorithm consisting of a series of
separate modules (Drakon-diagrams) and the main Drakon-diagram
containing the main program’s main Golang design:

Let's create the Drakon-diagram using the example of a program for determining the digital root. The digital root of a non-negative integer is the single-digit value obtained by repeatedly summing the digits of the number. This process continues until the result is a single digit. 

For example, let's take the number 12345.
The first sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
The fsecond sum = 1 + 5 = 6
Therefore, the digital root of 12345 is 6.

To solve the problem of finding the digital root of an integer, we will create four Drakon- diagrams: _module, main, digRoot and sumDigits_ (Figure 4.13.). 

image::Fig4_13_fourFunctions.jpg[width=400,height=200,align=center]

[.text-center]
Figure 4.13. _module, main, digRoot and sumDigits_

The function _module_ contains a call to the _main()_ function. The _main()_ function contains a call to the _digroot_ function with an integer specified (Figure 4.14.):

image::Fig4_14_moduleMain.jpg[width=400,height=200,align=center]

[.text-center]
Figure 4.14.Functions _module_ and _main_

The purpose of the function _digRoot(n)_ is to organize a call to a function _sumDigits(n)_ that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. In turn, the _sumDigits(n)_ function splits the string "_12345_" into individual characters, after which the sum of the corresponding integers converted by the _parseInt(digit, 10)_ function is calculated in a loop. (Figure 3.15.).

image::Fig4_15_digSum.jpg[width=600,height=300,align=center]

[.text-center]
Figure 4.15.Functions _digRoot_ and _sumDigits_

After creating the dragon diagrams, the program code for determining the digital root in the language () is automatically generated by activating the "wrench" icon (Figure 4.16.)

The result of automatic code generation in the language JavaScript:

[source,javascript]
----
main();
function bubble(n) {
    var sum, x;
    sum = 0;
    while (true) {
        if (x < 100) {
            break;
        } else {
            sum = sum + n;
            x = x + 2;
        }
    }
}
function digRoot(n) {
    var sum;
    sum = sumDigits(n);
    if (sum < 10) {
        return sum;
    } else {
        return digRoot(sum);
    }
}
function main() {
    console.log(digRoot(695));
}
function sumDigits(n) {
    var digit, digits, sum;
    sum = 0;
    digits = String(n).split('');
    for (digit of digits) {
        sum += parseInt(digit, 10);
    }
    return sum;
}
----

=== 4.6. Execution of the generated code

The generated code can be opened in one of the integrated development
environments (IDE): Visual Studio Code, VIM, Eclipse, Atom, Sublime Text
and a number of others. This book uses the IDE Visual Studio Code (VSC), the description of
which is not included here.

The execution of the generated program in the VS Code environment is carried out using the commandd: *node* _nameProgram.js_. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of the browser. Node.js extends the capabilities of JavaScript, allowing it to create various tools and applications. The installer of _Node.js_ is on the site _nodejs.org_. The generated program is launched via the terminal (Ctrl + `) or View -> Terminal.

Almost as part of the hybrid approach debugging program often have to be
carried out in parallel in two environments: DrakonTech and Visual Studio Code. 
Naturally, in case of graphical syntax errors a Drakon-diagram code generation will not be made.

The debugging process of the generated code is recommended to be carried
out with the help of the appropriate programming environment toolkit.
After debugging is complete, all corrections must be made to the
corresponding graphs in the Drakon-diagram. In any case, it is always
necessary to ensure that the contents of the diagramms correspond to the
 program code in the in the relevant IDE.
